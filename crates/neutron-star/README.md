# neutron-star

A trait-first, statically-dispatched box-layout engine for host-owned trees.
CSS **flexbox** is implemented; the CSS **Grid** host protocol is reserved for
the next algorithm milestone. Built as the from-scratch successor to the Lynx
C++ engine's `starlight` layout engine, but deliberately Lynx-agnostic: the
crate has zero required dependencies and is designed to be published and used
standalone.

> **Status: flexbox implemented (milestone L1).** The protocol, shared layout
> machinery, leaf/absolute sizing, cache, rounding, and CSS Flexbox Level 1
> algorithm are implemented. The Grid protocol is present; its layout
> algorithm remains milestone L2. See
> `docs/layout-architecture.md` in the repository root for the full design,
> algorithm plans, milestones, and rationale.

## Design in one paragraph

The engine owns **algorithms and vocabulary**; the host owns **the tree, the
styles, and all storage**. The protocol deliberately exposes those through
two separate objects: an immutable `LayoutSource` (`TraverseTree`,
`FlexSource`, `GridSource`) containing topology and computed-style views, and
a mutable object implementing `LayoutSession` (`LayoutState` + `CacheState`)
and, when pixel snapping is used, the independent `RoundState` capability.
That mutable side contains results, caches, measurement resources, and
display dispatch.
Recursion flows *through the host*: the engine calls
`LayoutSession::compute_child_layout(source, …)`, and the host dispatches each
child to the right algorithm — one of neutron-star's, or its own (this is how
Lynx's non-CSS `linear`/`relative` modes plug in as peer algorithms without
the engine knowing about them). The split lets Flex and Grid retain borrowed
style/track views while recursive layout mutates only the session.
`display:none` cleanup is an explicit host precheck: call `hide_subtree` and
return `LayoutOutput::HIDDEN` before entering the generated-box cache/dispatch
path.

## Hard rules

- **No `dyn`.** Every host boundary is generic. Source/measurement traits use
  GATs and mutable capability traits explicitly require `Sized`, so trait
  objects are impossible by construction and every call can inline.
- **No storage.** The engine allocates only transient algorithm scratch; node
  data, styles, caches, retained text layouts, and results all live in
  host-chosen storage addressed by opaque `NodeId`s. Semantic source data is
  immutable for a layout epoch; mutable results and caches live separately.
- **POD box protocol, lending measurement seam.** Layout inputs, outputs, and
  geometry are small `Copy`, `#[repr(C)]` where layout matters, and
  `f32`-based. `LeafMeasurer` may additionally lend an engine-specific rich
  artifact view; leaf boxing immediately copies its size/baselines into
  `LeafMetrics`, while the host retains the artifact for painting.
- **CSS-initial defaults.** Trait-method defaults are the CSS initial values;
  host-specific defaults (e.g. Lynx's `box-sizing: border-box` or
  `overflow: hidden`) are the host's job.

## Dependencies and feature flags

None, deliberately. The flex and grid protocols are core, unconditional API,
and the crate compiles with zero dependencies.

## Prior art

The source/session/style protocol split is informed by [Taffy]'s `LayoutPartialTree`
design (proven to keep a layout engine storage-agnostic without trait
objects), the implemented flex algorithm and planned grid algorithm by the
CSS specs directly (Flexbox Level 1, Grid Level 2, Sizing Level 3), and the
performance posture by `starlight` and [Yoga]. neutron-star shares no code
with any of them.
