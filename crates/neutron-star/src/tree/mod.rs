//! The tree protocol: how the engine sees the host's node tree.
//!
//! neutron-star owns **no tree**. The host keeps nodes in whatever storage it
//! likes (a slab, an arena, an ECS, a retained DOM) and exposes them through
//! the traits here, addressed by opaque [`NodeId`]s. The traits form a
//! deliberate hierarchy of *capability*, so each engine function demands only
//! what it uses:
//!
//! ```text
//!  TraverseTree            child access               (rounding, debug)
//!      └── LayoutTree      + style views, layout IO   (all algorithms)
//!           ├── FlexTree   + flex style views         (flex algorithm, L1)
//!           └── GridTree   + grid style views         (grid algorithm, L2)
//!  CacheTree               measurement cache slots    (compute_cached_layout)
//!  RoundTree: TraverseTree unrounded → final layouts  (round_layout)
//! ```
//!
//! # The recursion contract
//!
//! Layout recursion deliberately round-trips through the host:
//!
//! ```text
//!  compute_root_layout(tree, root, …)
//!      └─▶ tree.compute_child_layout(root, input)           [host dispatch]
//!            └─▶ <algorithm>(tree, root, input)             [engine algo]
//!                  ├─▶ tree.compute_child_layout(child, …)  [host dispatch]
//!                  │     └─▶ … per that child's display …
//!                  └─▶ tree.set_unrounded_layout(child, …)
//! ```
//!
//! [`LayoutTree::compute_child_layout`] is the **dispatch point**: the host
//! inspects the child's `display` (which the engine deliberately has no enum
//! for) and routes to an engine algorithm entry point (flexbox is implemented
//! as a `fn(&mut Tree, NodeId, LayoutInput) -> LayoutOutput` in
//! [`compute`](crate::compute); grid follows in L2),
//! [`compute_leaf_layout`](crate::compute::compute_leaf_layout) (text/images
//! via its own measure closure), or *its own algorithm* — this is exactly how
//! lynx-vello's non-CSS `display: linear`/`display: relative` modes plug in
//! as peer algorithms. The host handles `display: none` first with
//! [`hide_subtree`](crate::compute::hide_subtree), then wraps visible-node
//! routing in [`compute_cached_layout`](crate::compute::compute_cached_layout)
//! so every sizing path shares one cache policy. See the `compute` module docs
//! for the canonical dispatch skeleton.
//!
//! Because recursion passes `&mut self` back and forth, the protocol is
//! single-threaded per tree by construction; the planned intra-layout
//! parallelism protocol (batched child requests, see the architecture doc)
//! will be additive.
//!
//! # Object safety — deliberately absent
//!
//! Every trait here uses generic-associated-type iterators or style views,
//! which makes them structurally **not object-safe**: `dyn LayoutTree` is a
//! compile error, not a style-guide rule. The entire host⇄engine boundary
//! monomorphizes and can inline.
